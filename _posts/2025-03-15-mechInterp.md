date: 2025-03-15 16:40:16
description: A post on mechanistic interpretability and tranformerLens. This post is giving a basic introduction to mechanistic interpretability and ways to understand the inner mechanisms of transformer-style models like 'GPT-2'. We will try to locate responsible attention maps for specific biases in several prompts and validate the causal connection by removing parts of the network. We will make use of different datasets to validate the behavior and visualize the results. Finally we will talk about circuits and attention heads.
