Since August 2020, I am working as a <em>junior lecturer</em> in the Artificial intelligence master program at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). My contribution is in multiple courses: Machine learning, Deep learning, Fairness Accountability Confidentiality and Transparency in AI and Explainability and Interpretability in AI. Part of my role is to prepare materials, lectures and tutorials for all these courses.

I have acquired my Ph.D. in data science and knowledge engineering (DKE) at Maastricht University on cross-modal emotion recognition based on domain adaptation. My work utilized methods to bridge expressivity features from the audio and visual modalities and ways to elicit both to improve emotion recognition performance.
